OCaml bindings to [Jansson](https://github.com/akheron/jansson). 

> Jansson is a C library for encoding, decoding and manipulating JSON data. Its main features and design principles are:
>
> - Simple and intuitive API and data model
> - Comprehensive documentation
> - No dependencies on other libraries
> - Full Unicode support (UTF-8)
> - Extensive test suite

### Optional Libraries

If you have certain libraries installed, then you will also get access to some extra libraries. 

 - `Jansson.Ezjsonm` provides conversion functions from `Jansson.t` to `Ezjsonm.value` and back again.
